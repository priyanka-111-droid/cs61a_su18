'''
IMPERATIVE-> use statements, achieve goal -> C,Fortran
1. Procedural
    ->same as imperative 
    -> C
2. Object oriented 
    -> classes and objects 
    -> C++,Java,Python, SmallTalk(pure OOP),Simula(first OOP language)
3. Parallel processing 
    -> process instructions using multiple processors 
    -> NESL,C/C++


DECLARATIVE ->focus on what needs to be done, not how, ignore control flow
1. Logic
    -> Knowledge base + question gives result, like math proof
    -> used in AI 
    -> Prolog
2. Functional 
    -> execute series of math functions
    -> functions hide implementation (abstraction)
    -> Javascript,Haskell,Scheme(based on LISP)
3. Database/Data driven
    -> based on data rather than a series of steps
    -> CRUD operations
    -> SQL
